# Multilingual NLP Analyzer - Frontend

A modern React + TailwindCSS frontend for testing the Multilingual NLP Analysis API.

This project works with a backend API that fine-tunes transformer models for sentiment and toxicity detection in code-mixed Indian social media to address multilingual NLP gaps. You can find the backend repository here: [https://github.com/ananikets18/code-mix-social-media-python-backend](https://github.com/ananikets18/code-mix-social-media-python-backend)

This frontend project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 🎯 Quick Start
